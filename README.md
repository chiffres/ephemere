# Monney Ephemeral

> A living currency, designed to flow, not to stagnate.

## Philosophy

The Ephemeral Project is a radical exploration of the nature of value. It proposes an *anti-capitalist* currency model whose fundamental aim is to promote the circulation of wealth and discourage its *hoarding*.

Unlike traditional currencies which can be accumulated endlessly, the Ephemeral is designed to imitate the cycles of the living world. Its main rule is simple: wealth that does not circulate, that does not serve the community, returns to its state of potential.

This "disappearance" is not a destruction of value, but a transformation. It is inspired by the concept of "Fertile Silence": unused value evaporates and returns to a state of collective potential, from where it can be reborn and redistributed, like water evaporating from a stagnant puddle to fall back into beneficial rain.

Principles of Operation
The system is based on a few simple but powerful rules:

Valorization through Flow: Circulation is the engine of the economy. Not only does a circulating currency not lose value, but the very act of exchange can generate more, strengthening the vitality of the system.
Evaporation by Stagnation: An inactive portfolio sees its balance gradually decrease over time, following an exponential decay curve. This mechanism makes long-term accumulation counterproductive.
Regenerative Cycle: The system is designed to operate in cycles (e.g., monthly), where the "evaporated" value feeds a new collective distribution, ensuring that the game never stops.
